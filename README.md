# stock-prediction
Project based on predicting stock price using LSTM. <br>
<br>
In this repository, I explore the exciting realm of time-series analysis and deep learning to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
<br><br>
Overview<br>
This project is born out of a passion for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to forecast financial market trends. The main goal is to build an accurate and robust predictive model that can capture the intricate patterns within historical stock price data.
<br><br>
Key Features<br>
Data Exploration: Dive into the world of financial data, gaining insights from historical stock prices.<br>
LSTM Model: Harness the power of LSTM networks, known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.<br>
Accurate Predictions: Train the model rigorously to make precise predictions, allowing for informed decision-making in the stock market.<br>
Visualization: Visualize the model's predictions against actual stock prices, providing a clear understanding of its efficacy.<br>
How to Use<br><br>
Dataset: Gather historical stock price data for the desired stock.<br>
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for training the LSTM model.<br>
LSTM Model Training: Utilize the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the LSTM model on your prepared data.<br>
Prediction: Make predictions using the trained model and visualize the results.<br><br>
